00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,710
A portion of this video
was sponsored by Salesforce.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,250
This is the biggest, most
in-depth video about bowling ever.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,690
How bowling balls are made,
the best way to throw them,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,400
maximize strikes, how the lanes are oiled,

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,190
what it takes to be a pro

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,970
and how this sport has
continually been reinvented

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,008
for literally thousands of
years, up to the present day.

8
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:22,940
(bowling strikes)

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,560
This is the science of bowling,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,560
the most popular participatory
sport in the United States.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,300
I'm super impressed with how that went.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,160
- I'm even more impressed than you are.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
- What is inside a bowling ball?

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,430
I sent this ball to Creative Electron

15
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,050
to get a 3D x-ray scan

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,150
and this is the result.

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,990
What is that?

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,170
I always expected bowling
balls to be, you know,

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,120
perfect solid spheres, but
there's something inside here

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,450
and it's not symmetric

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,290
and it's not even centered in the ball.

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,950
So I went to Storm Bowling,

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,420
one of only 11 bowling ball
manufacturers in the world

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,580
to find out how bowling balls are made.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,550
- Yeah. Basically when
we make bowling balls,

26
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,040
we always start in the center

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,800
and the center part of the
bowling ball is the weight block.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,370
And as you can see this is an example

29
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,360
of an asymmetrical shaped weight block,

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
so it's actually a different shape

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,138
about the X, the Y and the Z axis.

32
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:20,721
(serene music)

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,470
- The weight blocks are embedded

34
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,993
in a core of lightweight glass beads.

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,600
- That is so silky-soft.

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,950
I feel like I have not
felt anything this soft.

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,990
What's the difference in density between

38
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,470
this sort of filling
material and this core?

39
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,310
- It's quite a bit.

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,910
About two and a half to
three times more dense

41
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,430
in the inner weight block

42
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,203
than it is in the core material.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,440
- If you were to look for
example at this actual core.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,130
Number one, it says 9 6 0

45
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,360
which means that it weighs 9.60 pounds.

46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,010
And then the description here underneath,

47
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,050
which is a 0 3,

48
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,000
this indicates what type of a
weight block is inside of it.

49
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,550
- What happens over here?

50
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,729
- So this area right here
is our urethane area.

51
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,400
So basically what we have

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,900
are a number of different
tanks that are set up.

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,150
So there's a chemical reaction that occurs

54
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,750
once it actually fills the mold

55
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,740
and we pour that cover stock
material around the pour.

56
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,733
It gets extremely hot in
just a matter of minutes.

57
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,640
You go right down here,

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,500
she's actually pouring the pin material

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,490
inside the tops of those cores.

60
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,680
So you can see for this
particular bowling ball,

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,640
it's a bright orange type of a material,

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,550
and she's actually filling that hole

63
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,913
with that plug material.

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,330
We've got the lane at the right here

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,110
which is where we take the
balls that come out of the mold.

66
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,270
And then they actually
spin almost 2000 RPM.

67
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,780
On top of there there's
the blades that come around

68
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,480
and it actually makes the
balls perfectly round.

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
So they'll actually trim those up.

70
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,230
- [Derek] Since the
balls are not symmetric,

71
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,640
they are heavier on one
side than the other.

72
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,170
- And you can see there the
last four or five pumps of air,

73
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,860
where it actually floats the
air then it stops and pauses,

74
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,440
that the ball has completely settled.

75
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,100
And then basically a needle will come out

76
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,380
from the bottom part

77
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,140
and all of a sudden it'll shoot it up.

78
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,150
And then it'll be where
the center of gravity is

79
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,500
on the surface of the ball.

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,400
- When it comes right
off the lane, right here,

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,160
it is extremely porous
and very, very dull,

82
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,900
and there is a ton of friction

83
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,810
between the ball and
the lane at this point.

84
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,520
So every ball from right
here will be smoothed up,

85
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,280
it's just a matter of how
much it's gonna be smoothed up

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,633
in order to get what
is the desired finish.

87
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,520
- [Derek] But before
they can use these balls,

88
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,890
they have to be drilled.

89
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,913
But that is specific to each bowler.

90
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,750
How many balls are you making a day?

91
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,533
- [Steve] We're making over
3000 balls in a day now.

92
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,523
they come out of this plant right here.

93
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,680
(smooth calm music)

94
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,893
- Wild.

95
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,527
I found the bowling ball
equivalent of clickbait.

96
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,317
"You won't believe your eyes",

97
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,037
"The mind bending hook".

98
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,630
- Right?
- Yeah.

99
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,810
It's how you have to sell your stuff.

100
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,720
I get it.
- Exactly. Yeah.

101
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,730
- [Derek] But how did
it come to be this way?

102
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,730
Well, bowling seems to be an ancient game.

103
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,120
Archeologists have found
wall drawings of a sport

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,240
that looks like bowling in
an ancient Egyptian tomb

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,200
dating back 7,000 years.

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,440
In Germany, bowling was
used as a religious ritual.

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,510
Pins represented your sins,

108
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,620
so you're a good Christian if
you could knock them all down.

109
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,360
Martin Luther himself was
apparently a bowling fanatic

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,130
and fixed the number of pins at nine.

111
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,330
When the game made its
way over to America,

112
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,860
nine-pin bowling was banned
because it promoted gambling.

113
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,000
The legend goes that people
cleverly came up with

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,220
10-pin bowling to get around the law.

115
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,720
Whoa, totally different game.

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,200
Today in the US, nine-pin
bowling is only played in Texas

117
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,450
because it was the one
state that didn't ban it,

118
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,253
instead, charging it tax.

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,300
Bowling lanes are about
three-and-a-half-feet wide

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,130
and 60 feet long down to the headpin.

121
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,530
I'm using Imperial units here

122
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,310
because that's actually
how they're defined.

123
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,870
The lane is made of 39 narrow boards

124
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,820
that bowlers number for reference.

125
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,700
They used to be made
of maple and pinewood,

126
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,360
but these days, most lanes are synthetic

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,770
and made of fine particles
coated with melamine resin.

128
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,360
One game of bowling gives you 10 frames

129
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,150
with two throws per frame

130
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,490
to try to knock down all 10 pins.

131
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,070
The highest score you can get
in a game without a strike

132
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,100
is only 190,

133
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,130
but strikes allow you to double
count your next two throws,

134
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,320
so a perfect game with all strikes

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,323
gives you a score of 300.

136
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,390
If you're anything like me,
如果你和我一样
137
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,590
the whole game is just
认为游戏的目的就是尽量让球走球道中央的直线
138
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,730
trying to throw the ball as straight as you can
认为游戏的目的就是尽量让球走球道中央的直线
139
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,970
down the middle of the lane, hit the headpin
并让球击中瓶堆中央的瓶
140
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,550
and try to take as many other pins down with it as possible.
并且让球尽可能多地击倒其他瓶
141
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,640
Do you wanna give me any tips or-
你能不能给我点提示……
142
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,960
- I've watched LeBron bowling,
you won't be worse than him.
我见过勒布朗打保龄球，你肯定比他好一些
143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,321
- You say that now you.
这可是你说的
144
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:00,904
(Chris laughs)

145
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,440
- See, that's what I would normally do.
你看，这就是我平时的水平
146
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,520
And I would normally be like
打成这个样子我已经很开心了
147
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,370
reasonably happy with a shot like that.
打成这个样子我已经很开心了
148
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,080
But for pro-bowlers like
Pete Weber or Chris Barnes,
但是对于像皮特·韦伯和克里斯·巴恩斯这样的专业球员来说
149
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,617
- [Narrator] For a perfect game,
【解说】打得漂亮！
150
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:11,720
- Yes!
YES！
151
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,540
- [Derek] The game is different.
这完全不是相同的比赛
152
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,742
And not just because they are way better than me.
不止因为他们的水平比我高
153
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,808
- [Narrator] And he get it!
【解说】他做到了！
154
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:17,954
(crowd cheering)

155
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:20,144
- Who you think that you are? I am.
你以为你是谁？我才是那个谁！！
156
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:23,970
(crowd continues cheering)

157
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,740
Hitting the headpins square on
瞄准首瓶出球
158
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,683
is not the perfect strategy.
并不是最佳策略
159
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,990
If you hit the headpin square on going straight,
如果你瞄准了首瓶直线出球
160
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,690
you're unlikely to knock down all the pins.
就很难把瓶都击倒
161
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,810
You could end up with a split
剩下的球会分开留在两侧
162
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,260
where the ball goes through the middle,
球从中间穿过
163
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,420
or with the ball deflecting off to one side
或者球在击中首瓶之后
164
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,100
after hitting the headpin.
滚到一边
165
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,120
Chances for a strike are much higher
要想一击全中
166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,140
if the center of the ball hits the pins
就要让球心击中首瓶的旁边的瓶
167
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,360
just to one side of the headpin.
就要让球心击中首瓶的旁边的瓶
168
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,590
Board 17 and a half.
在位于第17.5条木板的位置
169
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,910
In which case the ball takes
out the 1, 3, 5, and 9 pins,
此时球击中了第1、3、5和9号瓶
170
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,890
which take out the others.
这几个瓶再把其他的瓶击倒
171
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,840
- So we want the ball
to hit the 1 pin, the 3,
我想让球击中1号和3号瓶
172
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,230
the pin behind the 1, which is the 5 pin.
然后是1号瓶后面的5号
173
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,000
And then the 9 or the 8 and the 9.
然后是9号，或者8号9号一起
174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,552
- [Derek] You want the ball to hit all of those pins?
球只要击倒这几个就行了？
175
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:05,385
- [Chris] Yeah.
对
176
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,610
- Now the pins don't always fall this way,
此时还没有击倒所有的瓶
177
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,610
but the pin shape helps.
但是保龄球瓶的特殊形状能帮忙
178
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,950
Pins roll in circles like eggs,
瓶倒下后会像鸡蛋一样转圈滚
179
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,913
which help knock down the others.
从而帮助击倒其他的瓶
180
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,400
- That's right baby!
好球！
181
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,250
Come on, don't miss.
来嘛，好戏不容错过
182
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,140
You wanted it, you got it.
只要我想，我就能得分！
183
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,110
- [Derek] But to have an over 90% chance
不过，为了得到九成以上的全中
184
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,230
of getting a strike,
不过，为了得到九成以上的全中
185
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,000
the center of the ball has to hit
击中首瓶时的误差
186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,680
with an error smaller than half a board.
不能超过半个木板的宽度
187
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,780
Needless to say, throwing a ball 60 feet
同时投球的距离有60英尺（18.288米）
188
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,540
straight at a target smaller than a dime is a tough task.
看上去目标也就一个硬币大
189
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,350
Especially to do it consistently.
而且要求发挥稳定
190
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,380
Luckily there is a better way.
还好有个捷径
191
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,570
- Now, if we look at the pins
如果你在这里看球瓶
192
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,490
and as you look at them
from here, from straight on,
站在这里朝前看
193
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,660
the spot between the headpin,
首瓶，也就是最中间的这个
194
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,580
the one that's in the center,
首瓶，也就是最中间的这个
195
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,370
and the 3 pin which is just right at that,
和三号瓶，就是他旁边的这个
196
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,150
that gap's pretty narrow.
这两个瓶之间的空隙很小
197
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,010
But as the ball hooks more,
但是如果球路弯一点
198
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,910
now we basically shift over,
相当于从这个方向看过去
199
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,040
and now that space is considerably wider.
空隙就宽了不少
200
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
- [Derek] If you can hit the pins not head-on,
如果你不直直的朝着首瓶击球
201
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,660
but at an angle of six degrees,
而是偏转6度左右
202
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,840
you dramatically increase your chances
击球全中的概率就能明显提高不少
203
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,530
of knocking them all down.
击球全中的概率就能明显提高不少
204
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,430
Now the margin for error is greater.
此时投球误差可以稍微高一点了
205
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,440
The ball can be coming in
保龄球可以从第17到18.5条木板处击中球瓶
206
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,200
anywhere from board 17 to 18 and a half,
保龄球可以从第17到18.5条木板处击中球瓶
207
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,360
that is a board and a half of room.
总宽度达到了1.5条木板的宽度
208
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,520
And that still gives you
同时还能够保证你有九成以上的把握全中
209
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,660
greater than a 90% chance of a strike.
同时还能够保证你有九成以上的把握全中
210
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,650
Now, six degrees may not sound like a lot,
不过6度听起来不多
211
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,490
but it's actually extremely difficult to hit.
可实际上还是很难达到的
212
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,530
The problem is, if you wanted to throw the ball
问题在于，如果你想以6度的角度
213
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,250
straight at the pins and
hit them at six degrees,
直线投球击中四号球道的球瓶的话
214
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,700
you would have to be bowling from 3/4 over on the next lane.
你得在五又四分之三号球道投球才行
215
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,350
And that is impossible.
一般人可做不到
216
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,059
Well, with the two gutters in between and all.
尤其是每条球道旁都有两条沟
217
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,489
So the solution is
解决的方法是
218
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,460
you've got to curve the ball on one lane.
在这条球道内，让球走弧线
219
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,830
I feel like I have never spun a ball.
好像我从来没有试过旋转发球
220
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,360
Is that, (Derek laughs)
这个
221
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,330
Is that hard?
这个难不难？
222
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,257
- So if you've got it under your hand
只要用手抓球
223
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,750
and the ball's underneath,
让球在手下面
224
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,450
and you're trying to spin it,
然后尝试旋转球
225
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,410
that's especially the motion that players use these days.
现在大多数球手都是这么发球的
226
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,540
- [Derek] This really became
这位保龄球运动带来了很大的不确定性
227
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,820
a big part of the sport by accident.

228
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,210
- The wood gets beat up
球是砸在木板上的
229
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,650
with the damage from all the balls going into it.
由于受到了球的撞击
230
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,680
And so they basically created slip agents,
而且木板上还有一层润滑剂
231
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,310
lubricants much like oil on a car
有点像给车打蜡
232
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,950
so that the lanes didn't get damaged so quickly.
让球道不会那么快受损
233
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,060
- [Derek] So the original idea was to protect the wood.
润滑剂最开始的目的是为了保护木板
234
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,270
- The original idea was
是的，最开始是为了保护球道的木板
235
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,810
just to protect the surface of the lane.
是的，最开始是为了保护球道的木板
236
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,990
It was not to manufacture anything
并不是为了使比赛更有对抗性
237
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,940
for my competitive-scoring type environment.
并不是为了使比赛更有对抗性
238
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,300
- But applying oil to protect the wood
而是为了保护木板而涂油
239
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,520
meant that balls no longer grip the lane
导致了球不能很好的抓地
240
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,680
and roll without slipping down to the pins.
同时球也无法顺利旋转，击中球瓶
241
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,630
Instead they could skid,
而是会打滑
242
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,153
rotating not in their direction of travel.
使得无法沿着前进方向滚动
243
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,460
Now, I've been to a lot of bowling alleys
制作本期视频之前，我去了很多保龄球馆
244
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,610
before making this video
制作本期视频之前，我去了很多保龄球馆
245
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,380
and I noticed it was a bit greasy,
我发现球道都有些油腻腻的
246
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,840
but I always thought that was just
我以为这些球道就是这样的
247
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,490
the nature of bowling alleys.
我以为这些球道就是这样的
248
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,500
Like the stinky rental shoes.
就像那些臭烘烘的租赁球鞋一样
249
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,850
I didn't know they intentionally put oil on the lanes.
后来才发现这些由是专门涂上去的
250
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,810
Vox has a great video specifically about oil patterns.
Vox有一个专门介绍涂油的视频
251
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,300
These days, there are machines
现在有专门的机器用于在赛道上涂油
252
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,143
specifically for applying
oil to the lanes.
现在有专门的机器用于在赛道上涂油
253
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,927
- [Chris] And then as proprietors went,
后来场馆老板发现
254
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:02,340
"Huh, well yeah, it does make the ball skid.
“嗯，这样球会打滑”
255
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,500
Well, if I put more in the middle than the outside
“那我就在中间多涂点”
256
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,330
my baller's bowl a little bit better and they're happier."
“顾客发现球技提高了，也就更高兴了”
257
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,600
And then as technology advances like everything does
然后技术不断发展进步
258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,820
now we have $30,000 lane machines
现在这台机器要三万刀
259
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,610
that can put a specific amount of oil on each board.
能够按照特定的方式涂油
260
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,020
- [Derek] They work kind of like dot matrix printers.
机器的工作方式有点类似针式打印机
261
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,600
They can lay the oil on
可以把油滴按照特定的角度和厚度喷在球道上
262
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,090
with varying degrees of thickness across the lane
可以把油滴按照特定的角度和厚度喷在球道上
263
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,780
and extend the oil pattern different distances.
这样在球道上就能形成不同图案
264
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,210
There are hundreds of different patterns that can be used.
涂油的图案有几百种，各不相同
265
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,670
Usually the oil extends about 2/3 the way down the lane,
一般来说只在球道前2/3涂油
266
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,210
so to around 40 or 45 feet.
大约40到45英尺（12.19米到13.72米）
267
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,150
But there's always a dry patch of wood before the pins
不过在球道末端总有一段是干的
268
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,380
that increases the friction with the ball,
用于增加和球的摩擦
269
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,350
getting it to start rolling without slipping.
让球可以开始滚动，不再打滑
270
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,793
And this leads to the three  parts of any pro bowler's throw.
这就是专业球手的三大致胜诀窍
271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,833
The skid,

272
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,100
the hook

273
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,373
and the roll.

274
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,190
When a bowler releases the ball,

275
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,420
it can be going 20 miles an hour

276
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,810
and spinning at 500 RPM.

277
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,690
That's nearly 10 full
revolutions per second.

278
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,700
Right-handers typically
throw the ball to the right

279
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,260
on the lane while spinning it to the left.

280
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,100
During the skid phase, the
ball slides down the lane

281
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,160
spinning but not rolling.

282
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,620
As it comes to the end of the oil,

283
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,770
the friction increases and the
ball accelerates to the left.

284
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,970
It hooks because of its spin,

285
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,710
and the spin starts lining up
with the direction of travel,

286
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,260
leading to stage three, roll.

287
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,050
The ball is rolling without slipping

288
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,850
as it barrels into the pins.

289
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,113
Ideally, as close to that
six degree angle as possible.

290
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,200
Like the ball starts on
the left side of the lane,

291
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,531
goes straight across almost rightmost.

292
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:43,020
Then hooks like at the last
minute, rolls in there.

293
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,560
So that's almost like
a perfect shot, right?

294
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,320
straight in the pocket there.
- Close.

295
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,220
- Yeah. That's where you
want to hit the pins.

296
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,863
Yeah.

297
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:54,030
(ball hits the floor)

298
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,020
- My very first game,

299
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,000
it was ABC back then,
American Bowling Congress.

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,460
I filled out the application
to bowl in men's league.

301
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,540
Dad gave them the letter
saying that I could,

302
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,627
and the first game of bowl was 300

303
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,690
and they handed me a hundred dollars too,

304
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,140
and it was like, yeah, making money now.

305
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:16,330
And actually, my first,
my sixth, my ninth,

306
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,720
my 13th, 17th, 20th

307
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,350
were all 300 games.

308
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,000
I like, seven or eight 300

309
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,610
in my first year of men's league.

310
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,700
- [Derek] How do you explain that?

311
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,180
- To shoot 300

312
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,530
you have to get lucky
somewhere along the line.

313
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:36,655
Like that.
(Derek laughs)

314
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,790
Like that.

315
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,170
It came in to hit the 1 3, 5, 9.

316
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,763
And that that's what we
call the perfect shot.

317
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,940
- I mean, you just keep hitting them.

318
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,351
That's almost the identical shot.

319
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:55,870
Look at that, that yellow and the purple,

320
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,470
they're almost exactly
on top of each other.

321
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,870
- Oh, it just goes a little bit straight.

322
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,340
- That one, the purple one

323
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,030
was just a little bit
higher on the head pin,

324
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,893
but it still hit the 1,
3 and the 5 and the 9.

325
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,900
Can't get much better.

326
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,640
- [Derek] This type of
throw is only possible

327
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,230
because of the oil.

328
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,410
If you try to throw a ball the
same way on an unoiled lane.

329
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,700
Oh no.

330
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,660
It just doesn't work.

331
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,310
Can I actually ask you to
bowl like you normally would,

332
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,543
but on the dry lane?

333
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,860
I know it's crazy.

334
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,030
I just want to see what like
a normal shot would look like

335
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,680
If there was no oil.
- No oil.

336
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,660
It's gonna hit the lane
and go in the left gutter.

337
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,493
- That's what I want to see.

338
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:36,326
- All right.

339
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:38,120
You're gonna throw it just
like it's a regular lane.

340
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,233
- Yeah.
- All right.

341
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,730
- Oh yeah, there's no oil on the lane

342
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,790
so the ball can't get down.

343
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,170
As soon as it hits the lane,

344
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,740
it's going to start hooking, you know?

345
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,390
'Cause if you do this, who's
skidding a ball on this.

346
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,820
- So they want the oil.

347
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,063
- Yeah. We need the oil.

348
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,020
If we didn't have oil,
this is what it would be.

349
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,683
And nobody would have fun.

350
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,620
This is not fun.
- The bowling sucks,

351
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,062
We don't want to do this.

352
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:09,990
(Derek laughs)

353
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,100
- For pro bowlers, the oil on the lane

354
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,903
is a key part of the game.

355
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,793
- Oh whoa.

356
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,070
- Wow. Hey.

357
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,160
- Do you look at the oil?

358
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,970
Are you trying to scope it out

359
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,910
or are you just kind of guessing?

360
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,700
- I usually don't look at the oil.

361
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,790
I let my ball be the guide.

362
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,780
You know, I know some guys that are,

363
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,210
you know, they get down
like this and they look in

364
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,270
and it's like, oh, you know,

365
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,600
they're seeing the same thing I do

366
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,040
when I sit down, I go like that.

367
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,220
Nothing.

368
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,900
I see absolutely nothing.

369
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,420
- Whether you can see it or not,

370
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,180
figuring out the condition
of oil on the lane

371
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,883
can make the difference
between a strike and a miss.

372
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,530
As the game wears on the bowling
balls move the oil around,

373
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,930
pushing it further down the lane

374
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,543
and stripping it off
the most common paths.

375
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,550
So players have to adjust
to the changing conditions.

376
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,740
Some people say left-handers
have an advantage

377
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,930
because right-handers aren't playing

378
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,960
on their side of the lane.

379
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,030
At most bowling alleys,

380
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,640
they use a pattern of oil
that is thicker in the middle

381
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,930
and thinner out toward the edges.

382
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,710
This is a forgiving layout

383
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,550
because balls that drift too
far out start to hook earlier,

384
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,710
while balls going straighter

385
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,720
can continue down the lane for longer

386
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,540
before making their turn into the pins.

387
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,200
But for pro bowlers,
the oil conditions vary

388
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
and players have to adjust
their games to the conditions.

389
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,090
Some people seem to think
that like league bowlers

390
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,380
are better than they are, maybe,

391
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,730
'cause they say like,
"Oh, this league bowler

392
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,690
can shoot two 10, and I
just saw pro shoot two 10."

393
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,960
- That's why they call it league

394
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,200
because you bowl on the
same shot every week.

395
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,570
Because each week on tour,

396
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,340
I'm bowling on a different condition.

397
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,190
Not the same condition every week.

398
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,240
We have Cheetah,
Chameleon, Scorpion, shark,

399
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,750
one more.
- Bear?

400
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,900
- Bear. Yeah.

401
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,890
- [Derek] But it's not
just the oil on the lanes

402
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,990
that is transformed bowling.

403
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,260
It's also the balls themselves.

404
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,420
- Hard rubber bowling balls
was what I started with.

405
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,740
Maybe mid 70's and then the Yellow Dot,

406
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,490
the Columbia Yellow Dot,
which is a plastic ball.

407
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,140
And then they came out with
urethane bowling balls.

408
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,550
I won a lot of titles
with the urethane stuff.

409
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,000
And then they come out with the

410
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,730
reactive resin bowling balls.

411
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,030
- [Derek] Reactive resin is
just a modified polyurethane

412
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,700
with a more porous surface,

413
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,840
which gives it more grip in the oil.

414
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,750
It's the most popular
surface or cover stock

415
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,590
for bowling balls today.

416
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,920
Balls started out as perfect
symmetrically-weighted spheres.

417
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,470
And when you go to a bowling alley,

418
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,250
the house balls there are still just that.

419
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,150
But when you drill holes in the ball,

420
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,300
you take some weight out of one side.

421
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,610
So to rebalance it, ball manufacturers

422
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,030
added a small pancake weight
on the same side as the holes.

423
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,060
But then ball manufacturers got the idea,

424
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,240
they could add different
weights inside the ball

425
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,460
to improve their performance.

426
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,290
You can have two balls that
look identical from the outside,

427
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,310
weigh exactly the same amount,

428
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,890
and yet roll differently.

429
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,830
If the mass is more concentrated

430
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,410
around the axis of rotation,

431
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,380
say you have a dense
cylinder inside the ball.

432
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,920
Well then it has a
lower moment of inertia.

433
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,569
And this means for the same
amount of energy input,

434
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,409
it will spin faster.

435
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,609
In bowling, they prefer to talk
about an analogous concept.

436
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,289
Radius of gyration or RG.

437
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,329
If you were to concentrate
the entire mass of the ball

438
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,939
onto a hoop with the
same moment of inertia,

439
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,300
it's radius would be
the radius of gyration.

440
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,200
So smaller radius of gyration

441
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
just means lower moment of inertia,

442
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,450
which translates into more rotation

443
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,680
that a bowler can get on the ball.

444
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,110
- Some people are lower leverage

445
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,090
it just spins faster, like,

446
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,220
eh, it's of crazy, and then

447
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,320
somebody finally did a study on that.

448
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,750
Yeah, it turns out,

449
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,480
yeah, it's like 8%, you
know, for every 0.05.

450
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,330
And so it depends on
what your leverage is.

451
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,430
Can be fairly significant.

452
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,480
- [Derek] An ability to
spin the balls faster,

453
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,890
gives a bowler the
ability to hook the ball

454
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,160
more sharply further down the lane,

455
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,060
giving them a better chance of achieving

456
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,270
that six degree entry angle.

457
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,770
What was amazing for me to learn

458
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,520
is that the weight blocks in these balls

459
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,270
aren't even centered.

460
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,770
There's a heavy side and
a lighter side on purpose,

461
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,930
and you can find and mark this side

462
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,760
by letting the ball spin
freely on a cushion of air,

463
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,780
until it comes to rest, heavy side down.

464
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,400
They showed me a great demonstration

465
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
of how the position of
the center of gravity

466
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,363
can affect the movement of the ball.

467
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,670
When the center of mass is
on the left side of the ball,

468
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,420
it pulls in the same
direction as the spin,

469
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,130
helping the ball hook to
the left, into the pins,

470
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,740
- Same exact ball, same numbers,

471
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,750
just different static
and balance basically.

472
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,830
- [Derek] But here is
a flipped bowling ball

473
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,883
where the center of mass is on the right.

474
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,410
Now the ball starts to hook into the left,

475
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,300
but at the end, something weird happens.

476
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,690
The center of mass pulls
it over to the right.

477
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,680
This effect is only really noticeable

478
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,563
when the ball is thrown slowly.

479
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,980
These days, there are tons
of different weight blocks

480
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,620
that go inside bowling balls

481
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,850
and they can be grouped
into two categories,

482
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,210
symmetric and asymmetric.

483
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,840
For all these weight blocks,

484
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,390
the minimum moment of inertia

485
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,520
or in bowling terms, the smallest RG axis

486
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
is identified by a pin,

487
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,930
which is visible on the
outside of the ball.

488
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,940
It will spin most easily about this axis.

489
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,530
For the symmetric weight blocks.

490
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,790
The ball doesn't change as
you rotate it about this axis.

491
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,030
So the maximum moment of inertia

492
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,220
is rotating about any axis that passes

493
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,333
through the equator of the ball.

494
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,950
I certainly didn't expect bowling balls

495
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,690
to have asymmetric cores,

496
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,830
but it turns out what
looked like perfect spheres,

497
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,420
actually have three different
principal axes of rotation.

498
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,740
Minimum moment of inertia,

499
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,040
maximum moment of inertia

500
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,650
and intermediate moment of inertia.

501
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,150
- So this right here is our Dark Code.

502
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,763
This is one of our asymmetric ball

503
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:56,940
that has the Rad 4 core in it.

504
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,040
So this has a preferred spin axis.

505
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,916
And what we're going to do now

506
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,650
is we're going to put
it onto the determinator

507
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,750
and show how it actually
will spin it and find it

508
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,650
no matter how we position it on there.

509
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,430
- [Derek] So you spin
them up on this machine

510
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,560
until they settle into
the way they like to spin

511
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,800
where the bowlers call their
preferred spin axis or PSA.

512
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,330
But why would you want a
ball to be an asymmetric top?

513
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,610
Well, professional
bowlers drill their balls

514
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,750
so that at lunch the axis of
rotation is somewhere between

515
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,410
the minimum and maximum moment of inertia.

516
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,630
And as a result, as the ball
goes down the lane spinning,

517
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,400
it precesses like a gyroscope.

518
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
The axis of rotation rotates around

519
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,140
causing the point of contact

520
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,980
between the ball and the lane to change.

521
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,900
This precession means that

522
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,600
different parts of the
ball contact the lane.

523
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,870
And you can see this when the ball back

524
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,980
by the spread-out lines of
oil on the ball surface.

525
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,660
Bowlers call this track flare,

526
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,200
and it's desirable because it means

527
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,010
once the ball hits the
unoiled part of the lane,

528
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,430
it gets traction faster

529
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,680
and hooks more dramatically
back to the pins.

530
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,200
This is what asymmetric
cores are used for.

531
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,380
They have larger differences

532
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,180
between their moments of
inertia in different axes

533
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,480
or what bowlers call RG differential,

534
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,830
which makes the ball precess.

535
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,820
If you spin a ball around it's minimum

536
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,950
or maximum moment of
inertia, it processes less

537
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,690
and there's much less flair,

538
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,290
meaning oil builds up
on one part of the ball.

539
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,330
This reduces the friction
over the dry part of the lane

540
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,520
so the ball hooks less.

541
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,220
- See the oil there, very faintly,

542
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,940
but it's pretty much next to the finger,

543
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,200
right next to the thumb,

544
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,280
and it just continues to be right that way

545
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,120
all the way around the ball.

546
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,760
- [Derek] But how important are

547
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,920
each of these factors in
actually getting the best shot?

548
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,370
Well, the US Bowling Congress,

549
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,630
or USBC, the governing
body that sets all rules

550
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,590
and regulations for US bowling.

551
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,930
They did a landmark study in 2008,

552
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,460
trying to tease out the
most significant factors

553
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,250
that affect ball motion.

554
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,890
In order to determine the
impact of each factor,

555
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,780
they had to make sure that
throws were identical.

556
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,540
So they turned to Harry,

557
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,850
at the time, the most
consistent bowler in the world.

558
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,483
He is a robot.

559
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,590
Bowling robots are designed
to be able to throw

560
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,720
hundreds of identical shots.

561
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
In fact, the robot Earl,

562
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,320
Harry's successor in 2011,

563
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,090
actually lost to Chris
Barnes when he debuted

564
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,970
in part because his
throws were so consistent.

565
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,240
He wore away the oil in a
single part of the lane.

566
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,960
So his shots hooked too much.

567
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,130
The people managing him

568
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,110
did their best to adjust
to the oil conditions,

569
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,170
but few people are Chris Barnes.

570
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,090
The USBC ball motion study

571
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,190
used Harry to throw thousands of shots

572
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,590
with different bowling balls.

573
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,400
And they found that the center of gravity

574
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,760
affected the ball motion
relatively little.

575
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,750
Around the same level
as environmental factors

576
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,430
like room temperature or humidity.

577
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,370
RG, and RG differential,

578
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,960
essentially the moment of inertia

579
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,420
and difference between maximum

580
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,150
and minimum moments of inertia.

581
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,090
That affected the ball
motion significantly more.

582
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,260
But the factor that affected
ball motion the most

583
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,550
was the surface of the ball.

584
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,120
The top five individual factors were

585
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,260
the amplitude of surface roughness,

586
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,360
meaning the height of
microscopic spikes on the ball,

587
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,600
the coefficient of friction
with an oiled lane,

588
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,700
the surface roughness by spacing.

589
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,560
That is the distance
between microscopic spikes,

590
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,250
the coefficient of
friction with the dry lane,

591
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,660
and how quickly the ball
surface absorbs oil.

592
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,730
Now, bowlers recognize just how important

593
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,420
the surface of their ball is.

594
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,630
They pay close attention
to what it's made of

595
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,240
and how it's finished.

596
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,140
Rougher finishes,

597
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,950
give the ball more traction in the oil

598
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,150
and get it to start hooking earlier.

599
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,510
This is useful for long oil patterns

600
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,340
and slower axis rotation.

601
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,310
- Sometimes maybe I'll go
to a little more sanded ball

602
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,530
or a little more ball surface

603
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,750
to get it into a roll quicker for me,

604
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,610
because they use a lot of oil.

605
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,840
- These two shots are thrown identically.

606
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,280
The only difference is
the ball on the left

607
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,733
has a rougher surface.

608
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,490
Rough surfaces act like winter tires,

609
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,230
helping to dig into the oil
and give the ball traction.

610
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,900
They also act as badly as
winter tires on a clean road

611
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,440
on a totally dry lane.

612
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,010
They actually have less friction

613
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,760
because their rougher exteriors

614
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,363
mean that less surface
area is touching the lane.

615
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,940
You can get many different
levels of smoothness

616
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,330
up to a near mirror shine.

617
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,410
This is better for short oil patterns

618
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,400
to prevent the ball hooking
too much, too early.

619
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,010
Ultimately, pro bowlers
carry many different balls

620
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,120
to each competition.

621
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,660
- I'm not afraid to change
balls in the middle of the game.

622
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,270
I go to the game and I've got like

623
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,410
a spare, a spare, a spare.

624
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,060
All right. It's time to change balls.

625
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,893
- [Derek] Yeah.

626
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:49,880
- So now I gotta find the right ball to

627
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,360
get down the lane again
and find the proper,

628
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,350
which usually I have a pretty good idea.

629
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,720
- [Derek] So they select their ball

630
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,120
a little like a golfer selects their club,

631
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,753
to suit the conditions.

632
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,100
But does all this tech actually
make people better bowlers?

633
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,680
Well, over the last 20 years,

634
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,010
average scores have increased
by more than five points.

635
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,190
Plus the number of perfect 300 games

636
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,300
bowled per year per thousand bowlers

637
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,560
has increased dramatically
since the 1980s.

638
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,410
This graph shows the percent
change year over year.

639
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,590
In 1976, soaker balls,

640
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,770
balls chemically softened
to absorb oil and hook more,

641
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,290
were banned, and there was
a dip in perfect games.

642
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,840
But the same year a new
rubber ball was introduced,

643
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,860
the Brunswick LT-48

644
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,330
and more 300 were hit in
the years that followed.

645
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,200
In 1991, reactive resin
balls were introduced

646
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,660
and there was another significant jump.

647
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,460
Now, obviously there were
other improvements in equipment

648
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,340
and natural variability,

649
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,530
but some of the big changes do correlate

650
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,350
with the introduction
of new ball technology.

651
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,370
So yes, the wild bowling
ball technologies out there,

652
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,580
especially anything to do with surface,

653
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,840
significantly affect ball
motion and your bowling game.

654
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,060
But ball motion is
likely minutely affected

655
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,770
by hundreds of other factors.

656
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,510
Even the color of the ball
can have a small impact.

657
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,790
A USBC study in 2016

658
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,430
found that different pigments
absorb oil at different rates.

659
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,050
Bowling is the sport of re-invention.

660
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,740
That goes back to ancient Egypt,

661
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,380
but has transformed many times.

662
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,460
Now, when you get up
to throw a single shot,

663
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,500
you have to think about the
oil pattern on the lane,

664
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,160
the stage of the game and
how the pattern has shifted,

665
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,590
the weight block in your ball,

666
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,810
whether you want symmetric or asymmetric,

667
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,290
which axis you'll spin it
about to affect precession,

668
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,430
where the center of mass is

669
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,803
to pull the ball to
the left, to the right,

670
00:26:39,803 --> 00:26:41,620
what the cover stock is made of

671
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,670
and whether it's rough or smooth,

672
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,080
all to make a shot that
skids, hooks, and rolls

673
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,240
to the pins between boards
17 and 18 and a half

674
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,223
at as close to a six degree
angle as you can master.

675
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,960
Now do that again 12 times in a row

676
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,474
and you have a perfect game.

677
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,641
(techno sound effect)

678
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,020
Hey, this portion of the video
was sponsored by Salesforce.

679
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,230
Bowling may be complicated,

680
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,520
but managing relationships
with your customers

681
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,780
doesn't have to be.

682
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,360
In our modern work-from-anywhere world,

683
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,150
Salesforce makes it
easier for your business

684
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,010
to meet the needs of your customers.

685
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,950
You can help them find
answers about your business

686
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,030
by creating a help center page.

687
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,950
You can also meet your
customers where they're at

688
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,060
by connecting your email,
phone and social channels.

689
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,830
You probably spend a lot
of time on your website,

690
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,390
So make it work harder for you

691
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,050
by leveraging lead capture
forms from Salesforce

692
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,150
right on your site.

693
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,780
And you'll be able to
generate new business

694
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,710
and develop relationships
with your customers

695
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,470
straight from your CRM.

696
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,000
Sending out messages or
special promos is easy.

697
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Salesforce has a whole
array of personalization

698
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,260
and message targeting options.

699
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,240
So you can request a demo

700
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,890
or get started for just
$25 per user per month

701
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,430
at salesforce.com/veritasium.

702
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,380
I want to thank Salesforce

703
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,970
for sponsoring this portion of the video,

704
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,820
and I want to thank you for watching.
